We made this project on Mac OS (chip: Apple M1 / Intel core). Thus, we add all executable files.

Environment:
  - device: Mac OS / Windows
  - python version: 3.10

Excutable files are created on both Mac OS environments:
  - Mac m1: executable/gui_m1.exec
  - Mac intel: executable/gui.exec
  - Windows: executable/gui.exe

Initial input for executable files:
  - "IPL.txt" file (contained in zip) will be fetched to memory when you push 'init' button.

To run through python:
  - $python3.10 gui.py
